# AI Engineering Lab

This repository is a collection of experiments, prototypes, and learning projects around AI engineering.

It started as part of the **[AI Makerspace AI Engineering Bootcamp](https://aimakerspace.io)** and has since been cleaned up and renamed to serve as a personal lab for exploring topics like RAG, evaluation, agents, and LLM-based systems in more depth.

## What this repository is

- A place to experiment with AI engineering concepts
- A learning log in code form
- A sandbox to test ideas, architectures, and tooling
- A way to make my learning process visible and reproducible

Some projects are based on bootcamp material and notebooks provided by AI Makerspace. In those cases, my work focuses on:
- implementing the required tasks
- extending or modifying the given code
- experimenting beyond the original exercises
- documenting what worked, what didn’t, and why

## What this repository is not

- A polished product
- A showcase of production-ready systems
- A claim of deep real-world AI engineering experience

I’m a senior software developer, but still early in the process of building practical AI engineering experience.

## Structure

Each top-level folder represents a project or topic area.
Inside those folders you’ll find:
- project-specific code and notebooks
- short READMEs or notes describing the goal and approach
- experiments in various stages of completeness

Over time, this repo will also include non-bootcamp projects and more independent experiments.

## Notes

The code here favors clarity and learning over optimization.
Some approaches are intentionally naive or exploratory.
Assumptions and trade-offs are documented where relevant.
