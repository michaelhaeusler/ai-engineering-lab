        "\n",
        "**Agent Performance Comparison**\n",
        "\n",
        "The experiments show clear differences between the Simple Agent and Helpfulness Agent. The Simple\n",
        "Agent completed queries in an average of 5.9 seconds, while the Helpfulness Agent took 12.31\n",
        "seconds - more than twice as long! This performance difference comes from the additional evaluation\n",
        "and refinement steps in the Helpfulness Agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Helpfulness Agent achieved an average helpfulness score of 0.9 out of 1.0, which shows good\n",
        "response quality. However, it only triggered one refinement across all four test queries. This\n",
        "means most responses met the quality threshold on the first attempt.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tool Selection Patterns**\n",
        "\n",
        "Both agents used the appropriate tools for different query types. For document-specific questions\n",
        "about the Direct Loan Program, both agents correctly used the RAG retrieval tool. For current\n",
        "events about AI safety, both selected the Tavily web search. For academic papers, both used Arxiv\n",
        "search.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, the Helpfulness Agent sometimes chose not to use any tools for questions it could\n",
        "answer directly, while the Simple Agent consistently used tools when available. This shows\n",
        "different decision-making strategies between the two architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cache Performance Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "The cache performance test showed a 2.2x speedup on the second identical query. This is much lower\n",
        "than the 800x+ speedups seen in direct embedding and LLM caching tests earlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason for this difference is probably the agent overhead. Even with cached data, the agent \n",
        "still needs to process messages through the LangGraph state management, make routing decisions \n",
        "about tool selection, and execute the graph flow. These operations take time regardless of caching.\n",
        "Additionally, agents make multiple LLM calls during execution, and only some of these calls hit the\n",
        "cache on repeated queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "While 1.7x is not dramatic, it still shows the cache is working and provides value for cost\n",
        "reduction and latency improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Error Handling**\n",
        "\n",

        "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
        "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
        "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
        "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
        "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
        "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
        "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
        "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
        "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
        "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
        "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
        "\n",
        "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
        "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
        "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
        "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
        "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
        "\n",
        "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
        "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
        "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
        "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
