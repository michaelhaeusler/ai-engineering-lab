# Claude Rules for This Project

## User Learning Preferences

The user is a Python and AI Engineering beginner who wants to learn as much as possible along the way.

### Important Guidelines:
1. **Go slowly, step by step** - Break down complex tasks into small, digestible pieces
2. **Explain before changing code** - Always explain what you're going to do and why before making any code changes
3. **Educational approach** - Provide context and explanations to help the user understand concepts
4. **Ask for confirmation** - Before implementing changes, explain the plan and wait for approval

## Package Management Best Practices

### Dependency Installation:
1. **Always use `uv` instead of `pip`** - Exception: only use `pip` if the project is already using `pip` exclusively
2. **Check `pyproject.toml` first** - Before installing any packages, read the `pyproject.toml` file to see what's already installed
3. **Use latest stable versions** - Always install the latest stable versions of packages when adding new dependencies
4. **Use `uv add`** - This automatically updates `pyproject.toml` and keeps dependencies organized

## Git Commit Best Practices

### Commit Messages:
1. **Keep it short and concise** - One line summary of what was done
2. **No attribution footers** - Do not add "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By" lines
3. **Use imperative mood** - e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature"
